# stock_market_prediction_using_Google_Trends_data
Based on Sentiment Analysis principles I try to utilize Google Trends data in building a working trading strategy for predicting future yields/prices.


This is the fifth iteration of my research on how Google search volume could be utilized in stock market prediction. 
Please read my thesis/research paper for further insights and please respect the below principles:
- I believe I managed to solve a few technical issues considering data download, standardization and other biases. Please feel free to use/change my scripts.
- If you end up using my scripts, thoughts, findings, please consider referencing my work.
- Feel free to contact me in case of any relevant questions, I spent a considerable time working with Google datasets.
